## 😶‍🌫️ About Me

---
---
Hey there, I'm Akash Sanjeev, a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at Goa College of Engineering. I'm passionate about software development, and my interests include native and hybrid app development, machine learning, backend, and competitive coding. In other words, I love anything that involves staring at a screen for hours!

In my free time, you can usually find me scouring the internet for new coding tutorials or desperately strategizing my next move on Chessboard (or, you know, losing miserably).
